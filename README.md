What is Wikification? This Wikification project is based on another context-based Wikification method: the Wikisim project by Armin Sajadi and Ryan Amaral.


Our work aims to implement a method that performs entity disambiguation and links to Wikipediaâ€™s most relevant pages. 

We demonstrate that using overlapping windows instead of disjoint windows in the baseline key entity-based approach of Wikisim leads to a new Wikification system with increased accuracy while increasing the computational cost only slightly. 

We named this first overlapping Windows algorithm 1, OWCW (Overlapping-Windows Concept Wikifier), and further improved it by ranking senses based on similarities to the context in algorithm 2, as CACW (Context-Aware Concept Wikifier).
